# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case as shown in [Patrick Collin's Hardhat Simple Storage](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-simple-storage-fcc) unpdated for Hardhat 2.16.1 and Ether 6.4.1. Note, however, the automated verification will only work **intermittenly** on Goerli Etherscan. See [Issue with Latest Hardhat 6.6.2](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-simple-storage-fcc/issues/54). 

I'm uploading this project so that the others who are monitoring the above issue can try the code. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
